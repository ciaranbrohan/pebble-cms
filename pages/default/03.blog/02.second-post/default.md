# Another Blog Post

This is our second blog post, demonstrating how the numeric prefix system works with multiple posts.

## The Structure

Notice how:
- The blog section is prefixed with `03`
- Each post is prefixed with `01` and `02`
- The URLs will be clean: `/blog/first-post` and `/blog/second-post`

## Benefits

This structure allows us to:
- Keep posts in chronological order
- Maintain a clean URL structure
- Easily add new posts in between existing ones
